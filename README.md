# 📚 Generalised Data Structures Library

## 📌 Project Description

This project implements a Generalised Data Structures Library using template-based programming in C++.  
The library provides reusable implementations of various Linear and Non-Linear Data Structures that can work with multiple data types.

It demonstrates dynamic memory allocation, pointer-based implementation, and generic programming for efficient data storage and manipulation.
